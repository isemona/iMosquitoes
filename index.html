            The Center for Conservation and Research Training at the University of Hawai`i and the Departments of
            Microbiology, Entomology and Genomics at the California Academy of Sciences are testing the feasibility of
            mosquito sampling by citizen scientists, focusing first on adult mosquitoes.

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="second-banner" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="second-banner-tab">
            We have already collected over 1,000 photo-based records in the mosquitoes in Hawai`i project. While over
            80% of these pictures are readily identifiable we do not have any genetic information on these mosquitoes.
            With your help we will be able to begin to characterize the likely source of these invasive insects and
            equally
            importantly discover and document any interesting microbes that they may be harboring.
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="third-banner" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="third-banner-tab">
            As an active participant in the Mosquitoes in Hawai`i project we realize you have already document
            mosquitoes in
            your home location including knowledge of the watery habitats where you may find larvae, eggs and adults.
            But we
            haven’t yet gotten any samples returned from these sites. After you have collected locally if you have
            transportation and the interest we welcome collections from all over the islands. Note that the further
            apart
            your samples are, the more likely we will recover variable genetic signals.
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fourth-banner" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="fourth-banner-tab">
            Each kit contains all you need to photo document any dead adult mosquito then save this mosquito in a
            pre-numbered bar-coded tube either RNA Shield (orange caps) or 80% Ethanol (green caps). We are testing both
            types of preservative to see which ones work better when handled in the field and then returned via post.
            Below
            you will find listed all the materials provided as well as step-by-step instructions for sample return.
        </div>
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fifth-banner" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="fifth-banner-tab">
            As always, SAFETY first, the RNA Shield and 80% Ethanol are not especially toxic but also they are for
            children, please use gloves when handling and if you get any on you just wash off using soap and water. For
            more
            information on each, please see the enclosed Material Data Safety Sheet. Also, important, please follow good
            safety measures to avoid getting bitten, but when that pesky adult mosquito is trying to bite you, use the
            kit to capture it for science! Be advised we are testing out sample return and we really welcome your
            constructive feedback as we streamline the kits and directions. Thanks so much for your efforts!

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2></br> 
        <br><h3>STEP 1: CATCH & KILL</h3></br>
        <p>Catch adult mosquito using a cup & a piece of paper (or any way you can).
        Wait until the mosquito lands on a surface
        Put the cup over the mosquito 
        Insert the piece of paper underneath the cup
        Transfer the mosquito in the cup to a freezer
          Freeze for at least 1 hour</p>
        <h3>STEP 2: RECORD</h3>
        <p>Wearing gloves, lay out the frozen mosquito on a piece of white paper.
        Take pictures of the mosquito (use the camera lens provided) following directions here:
        https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/mosquitoes-in-hawaii/journal/5829-tips-on-mosquito-photography-continued
        Do multiple views: back (scutum), abdomen, side (lateral), frontal (head), legs 
        Pick one sample tube. Label the tube with today’s date and your iNaturalist ID name 
        Use forceps, gently transfer the mosquito into the tube (one mosquito per tube). Close and gently tilt the tube upside down in order to submerge the mosquito in the liquid.  It may take several tries, if necessary use the tweezers to poke mosquito into the liquid (clean tweezers with wipe, ethanol from another tube or soap and water afterwards). 
          <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: take pictures of the tube’s bar-code and the label.
        Create a record with the GPS the GPS coordinates in the iNaturalist app. Import all photos of the mosquito and the photo of the tube barcode and label. Ensure you have correct date and location of the original capture location.
        Store the mosquito tubes upright with mosquitoes at the bottom (in the liquid) in your freezer until you are ready to send.</p>
        <h3>STEP 3: SAMPLE RETURN</h3>
        <p>Double check tubes are tightly sealed
        Put mosquito tubes inside the provided Ziploc bag with paper towel (in case tubes leak) and seal then put into the envelope.
        For return address, use your iNaturalist username and an address. 
          The return address is for postal purpose, we will not record your address. </br>
